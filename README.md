# Crowdfunding Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of a crowdfunding dataset in Excel. The dataset includes information about various crowdfunding campaigns, such as their outcomes, funding goals, backers, launch dates, and more. The main goal of this analysis is to uncover market trends and gain insights from the data using various Excel functions, pivot tables, charts, and statistical analysis.

1. Prepare the Data 
We will start by importing and merging the data from the sample-project Excel workbook. We'll also check for any data quality issues and perform necessary cleaning.

2. Conditional Formatting
We will use conditional formatting to visually represent the outcomes of each campaign with different colors based on their success, failure, cancellation, or live status.

3. Calculate Percent Funded 
A new column called "Percent Funded" will be created to calculate how much money each campaign made relative to its initial funding goal. We will use conditional formatting with a three-color scale to represent the percentage of funding received.

4. Calculate Average Donation
We will calculate the average donation made by each project backer and create a new column to store this information.

5. Split Categories
Two new columns, "Parent Category" and "Sub-Category," will be created by splitting the existing "Category" and "Sub-Category" columns to provide more detailed analysis.

6. Category Stats 
A pivot table will be created to analyze the number of successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns per category. We will visualize the results using a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country.

7. Subcategory Stats
A pivot table will be created to analyze the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns per sub-category. We will also create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category.

8. Date Conversion
We will convert the dates in the "deadline" and "launched_at" columns from Unix timestamps to Excel's date format using formulas.

9. Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We will create a new sheet with a pivot table to analyze the outcomes of campaigns based on their launch date. A pivot-chart line graph will be generated to visualize this data.

10. Crowdfunding Goal Analysis
A new sheet will be created to perform an analysis of crowdfunding goals. We will create a table and a corresponding graph to show the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects based on their funding goals.

11. Statistical Analysis
\
We will create a new worksheet and calculate summary statistics for the number of backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns. The mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation will be computed and analyzed.

Final Report
A report will be created in Microsoft Word to answer specific questions related to the crowdfunding data, draw conclusions about market trends, identify limitations of the dataset, and propose additional tables and graphs that could provide valuable insights.

Feel free to explore the Excel workbook and its analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the crowdfunding dataset and the uncovered market trends. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out!
